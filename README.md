# minesweeper-js
Minesweeper game built with pure JS. 

Original insipration came from Cody Seibert, from his his youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iscLNDuFLHU)

Decided to implement same project using pure javascript, to take advantage of native language capabilities and to learn how and why javascript works.

Enjoy!
