# minesweeper-js
Minesweeper game built with pure JS. 

Original insipration came from Cody Seibert, from his his youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iscLNDuFLHU)

Decided to implement same project using pure javascript, to take advantage of native language capabilities.

Features added also include: timer, drop down selection for difficulty, score board and start button

Here's what it looks like so far : [DEMO](https://minesweeper-demo-app.herokuapp.com/)
